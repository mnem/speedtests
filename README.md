# Some Speed Tests

To reassure myself that I'm not using C++ in an obscenely inefficient way compared to C.

Build instructions (assuming you have [cmake][] installed):

    mkdir -p build.cli
    cd build.cli
    cmake ..
    make

That should generate an executable which you can run:

    hosts/cli/speedy
